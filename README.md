**Project Name: WEB BASED ONLINE CONTINUING AND DISTANCE EDUCATION E-LEARNING SYSTEM**  
Introduction:
The containing and distance education process is one of the basic subsystems of teaching and learning systems. Currently in Jimma University, the distance education is going on manually. Because of this manual system has so many difficulties in its progress in terms of effectiveness. Some of those difficulties are students do not get updated information, students cannot get fast access to reading materials, submission of assignments is not secure, it may be lost before reaching the office.
The Continuing Education Program at Jimma University was first started in 1980 at Jimma College of Agriculture to train the students in general agriculture at diploma level. Even though there was high demand of distance and off campus programs from different stakeholders, due to various reasons there was only one program in distance, management at certificate and diploma level at the College.
